<summary>Development Process</summary>
Created a repo and cloned to local computer

Created html and css structures

Created a key from openweathermap's api and attempted to get fetches working properly...

Did more research and studying on API's and also the use of queryselector

Current weather fetch worked and struggled on 5-day forecast, ended up using REDUCE for averaging the collected 3 hour data! Woo hoo

Understood that I could group the data of 3 hour intervals into a 5 day format that I could use to populate the correct data

Adjusted cosmetic stuff from how the data rendered

Added the saving and rendering of cities searched

Updated my READMe and used previous guidance from graded homework to improve my README's
